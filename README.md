# To-Do-List App

This project involves building a to-do list application using React.js and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to add new tasks, delete existing ones, and toggle the completion status of each task. The application also saves tasks in the browserâ€™s local storage, ensuring that the to-do list remains intact even after the browser is closed and reopened.
